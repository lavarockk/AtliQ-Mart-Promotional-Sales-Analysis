DEALS! DEALS! DEALS! What’s not exciting about OFFERS? Let’s look at what offers worked best for AtliQ Mart. Come join me on this analysis of the Codebasics Resume Challenge, based on the FMCG domain “Analyse Promotions and Provide Tangible Insights to Sales Director”.
Problem Statement: AtliQ Mart is a retail giant with over 50 supermarkets in India. All the stores had promotional sales during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. Sales Director Bruce Hariyali wants tangible insights regarding these promotional sales to make informed decisions for their next sales.

Teck Stacks:

•	Microsoft Power BI
•	Microsoft SQL
•	Microsoft PowerPoint

Insights: 

•	Madurai has the highest Incremental Revenue%(IR%) of 120% and the highest Incremental Sold Units% (ISU%) of 225.12%.
•	The top 3 cities performing well are Bengaluru, Chennai, and Hyderabad. 
•	The bottom 3 cities that need improvement are Trivandrum, Vijayawada, and Mangalore.
•	Revenue after promotions is the highest for the 500 Cashback promo type which is 158M INR followed by 95M INR for the BOGOF promo type.
•	The  25% OFF,  33% OFF and 50% OFF promo types showed a decrease in revenue after the promotion.
•	The top 3 categories w.r.t IR% are Home Appliances, Home Care, Combo1.

Recommendations:

•	Update the inventory regularly and make sure not to overstock items that are not in demand, in our case Personal care category products. Maintain a proper balance between customer demand and inventory.
•	Creating Combo packs and BOGOF offers are great ideas and are working well in our case, so we can continue doing this.
•	Implementation of loyalty points will increase more customers.
•	Take customer feedback regularly to cater to the needs of customers rather than stocking products that customers don’t need.
•	Advertise the promotions well in advance so more people will know about our offers, and they can also plan to stock up their inventory.
•	Also enabling online purchasing will increase our sales.
•	Target on selling high-priced products to increase revenue.
